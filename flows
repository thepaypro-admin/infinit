In order to log in in the app, the following parameters should be introduced:
{ "username":"Apk_Paypr0", "password":"" }
Once the log in has been done, we have to keep the cookie sessionID and the token, so that they can be used in every web service.
Then, go through OTP verification, password creation, and user registering.
Once the user has been registered, the user login would be done. Afterwards, the user would have permission to operate.

 # Receive flow In the receive part of the application, two important things are showed:
A QR Code with the user public address.
The public address itself, which can be copied to clipboard by pressing it


 # Support flow
Pressing on Open Messenger, the user is sent to the Intercom interface.
In the Intercom interface, there exists the possibility to continue with an existing conversation or to start a new one.

 ## API Intercom
The guidance for Intercom integration is: https://developers.intercom.com/installing-intercom/docs/welcome
iOS Intercom integration
Instalation
Install Intercom by using CocoaPods:
    pod 'Intercom'
Add the following line to Info.plist:
    Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description
An explanation of the reason can be added in “Value” :
Write down ‘iOS API Key’ and ‘Your API ID’. These can be checked in the Intercom web going into: Settings > Installation > iOS
In AppDelegate, add:
    import Intercom
Finally, inside didFinishLaunchingWithOptions, add the following:
    Intercom.setApiKey("Your iOS API Key", forAppId: "Your App ID")
Users registration
Before initializing a new conversation, the user must be registered. This can be done registering an anonymous user or a known user
If an anonymous user is intended to be registered, inside didFinishLaunchingWithOptions, right after Intercom.setApiKey(…), add the following
Intercom.registerUnidentifiedUser()
In an application like Infinit, every user must have completed the login before launching Intercom. Therefore, they should be added to Intercom as known users.
Users can be registered with an individual indentifier:
Intercom.registerUser(withUserId: "...")
By using an email address:
Intercom.registerUser(withEmail: "...")
Or both:
Intercom.registerUser(withUserId: "...", email: "...")
However, they use userName as an individual indentifier.
Updating users
Further information can be collected from users so that their Intercom profiles are more complete. The different attributes are saved in ICMUserAttributes, and it is updated by Intercom.updateUser():
let userAttributes = ICMUserAttributes()    userAttributes.name = "Bob”    userAttributes.email = "bob@example.com”    Intercom.updateUser(userAttributes)  
Besides from the default attributes, new ones can also be added.
userAttributes.customAttributes = ["paid_subscriber": true, ”monthly_spend": 155.5, "team_mates": 3]

 # Send flow
Selection of the contact or public address to which a transaction is desired to be done. There exists two ways to perform this:
Pressing onto “Not in my contact list”, by which the user is sent to a view with two options: the possibility to type in the wallet public address of the beneficiary, or the possibility to scan a QR Code by which an address is obtained.
Pressing onto one of the existing contacts in the list
Choose an currency from the picker view, and type in the amount desired to be sent. This amount must be less than the total amount the user has in his account. If every parameter satisfies every condition, by pressing next, the following view is launched.
In the message view, a message for the transaction can be added. This is only optional so, if the message is empty, there will be no error.
Confirm view, where the user can check the parameters entered and, in case there is any error, the user can go back and fix them. By sliding the bottom bar, the transaction is completed and the user has to wait for the server response.
Finally, if everything is correct, the transaction is done and confirmation view is launched. On the other hand, if any error is encountered, the application goes back to the confirm view, showing an alert stating the error.


 # Account flow
Account can be divided in Balance and Transaction History. Both options can be found on the segmented control located on top of the view.
 ### Balance 1. All the tokens the user owns are displayed on this view, as well as the amount of each token. By using the Search bar on top, the user can look for a specific token in the list. 2. By pressing on “Add Token”, addNewTokenView is displayed. This view has 4 text fields where all the information must be filled in in order to add a token to the user’s list.

 ### Transaction History 1. Every transaction is displayed on this view. The user can scroll down and see all the transactions done. 2. If any of the transactions is pressed, the details of such transaction are showed. The last detail in this view, that is, Transaction hash, can be copied to clipboard by pressing on it.


 # Settings flow
Several actions can be done in this section:

 ### Profile Picture
By pressing on the profile picture on top, an alert is showed on screen asking whether you want to select the profile picture from Gallery or by opening the Camera.
Both, doing it with the camera or looking for it in the gallery, will end up changing the profile picture.
 ### Private key
By pressing onto Private key in, the application launches a view where the user has to confirm his password.
If the password from the previous step is correct, the application navigates to a view where the user’s private key is showed. This key can be copied to clipboard by pressing on it.
 ### Password
By pressing onto Password, the application launches a new view where the user can choose his new password.
By clicking on done, the application navigates to a new view where the user has to confirm the password, and if everything is correct, the password changes.
 ### Gas price
By pressing onto Gas Price, the application launches a new view where the user can choose the gas price from a picker view. The minimum to choose is 1 Gwei, and the maximum is 100 Gwei.
Pressing onto save, the new gas price is saved for the user. On the other hand, if the user presses back, the gas price is not updated.
 ### Gas limit
By pressing onto Gas Limit, the application launches a new view where the user can type in the gas limit in a text field.
Pressing onto save, the new gas limit is saved for the user as long as it satisfy the condition that the gas limit is higher than 0. On the other hand, if the user presses back, the gas limit is not updated.
 ### Web links
About us: pressing on it, the application launches an external link.
Rate us: pressing on it, the application redirects the user to the application link on the respective store: Apple Store for iOS and Play Store for Android.

 ## Android - Fabric The application has the fabric SDK using the crashlytics funcionalities. In order to use crashlytics properly you need to add manually the Fabric api key in the fabric.properties file with this format apiKey={your public fabric key}. This way the Fabric SDK will get your public key inside this folder and will upload the app and the crashes to the correct Fabric account. You can find below an example of the fabric.properties file needed, the apiSecret key in this file is provided by Fabric and you don’t need to add it. (The keys inside the file are not real)

 ## Android - Arquitecture
The architecture of the app is based on the MVVM model, to make the development easier with this model, the following libraries that Google provides us are used:
DataBinding to link the views with the logic of the app (https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/?hl=es-419)
MVVM for the creation of the ViewModel (https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
Lifecycle to facilitate the life cycle of the activities and fragments (https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle)
LiveData for the creation of observables (https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
WorkManager to facilitate the management of asynchronous processes (https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/)
Apart from these libraries provided by Google, the following are also used to facilitate the development:
Dagger2 for dependency injection (https://google.github.io/dagger/users-guide)
Retrofit2 for communication with the back-end (https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
Rxjava2 for the creation and treatment of complex observables (https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
